# Basic Pop-up
This describes how to make the basic pop-up with the rectangles.

## What you need
Making pop-ups are not hard! All you need is a piece of paper, something that you can draw with, and something you can use to cut. 

It's always a good idea to also prepare a ruler, you will need to draw and cut some straight lines. Although I like to use a cutting mat and a craft knife, some used shipping box with other cutting tools also work :)
