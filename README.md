# Basic Pop-up
This describes how to make the basic pop-up.

## What you need:
Making pop-ups are not hard! All you need is a piece of paper, something that you can draw with, and something you can use to cut. 

It's always a good idea to also prepare a ruler, you will need to draw and cut some straight lines. Although I like to use a cutting mat and a craft knife, some used shipping box with other cutting tools also work :)

## Let's make a pop-up!
Steps | Pictures
------------ | -------------
First you need to decide where to fold the paper. I usually use the middle line of this paper.| ![step 1 picture](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/basic-popup/blob/master/Steps/Step%201.JPG)
Then, you can draw a shape you like. It can be any shape, anywhere on the paper, as long as part of it pass the line you choose. It will be easier if the top and bottom of the shape are parallel to the line.| ![step 2 picture](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/basic-popup/blob/master/Steps/Step%202.JPG)
Now you need to draw another line above the shape. The distance from this line to the top of the shape should be the same as the distance from the bottom of the shape to the fold line.| ![step 3 picture](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/basic-popup/blob/master/Steps/Step%203.JPG)
Now draw some vertical lines, each of them should connect the vertices of your shape to the top straight line you just drew.| ![step 4 picture](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/basic-popup/blob/master/Steps/Step%204.JPG)
Cut the paper along both sides of your shape(including the vertical lines you just drew), but don't cut the top and bottom!| ![step 5 picture](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/basic-popup/blob/master/Steps/Step%205.JPG)
Find these lines: two horizontal lines between the two vertical lines, part of the line drawn in the first step and not covered by the shape, and the bottom line of the shape.| ![step 6 picture](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/basic-popup/blob/master/Steps/Step%206.JPG)
Mountain fold the top line of the shape (the second line from the top of all the lines you just found), and valley fold all other lines. You just made a pop-up! | ![step 7 picture](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/basic-popup/blob/master/Steps/Step%207.JPG)

## What's more?
Follow these steps, you can now make a lot of different pop-ups! Here are some examples:

The red line represents the mountain fold and the blue line represents the valley fold. I usually use black lines to indicate cuts.
